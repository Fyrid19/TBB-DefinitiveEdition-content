The aftermath of the Takeover week... it's time for one last show down!!
An extension of a remake Tom made of the original song from Wahoo Takeover. The original idea was that it would be a marathon song, and there were a bunch of other smaller ideas on top of that. Too many to list. Just know that most of this was in fact part of at least one original plan for the song.
