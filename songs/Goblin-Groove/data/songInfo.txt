Tom got lost in the middle of the forest, and came across a GOBLIN!?!? Looks like Tom's in a bit of a pickle!
This song was created because of an inside joke that there should be a mod where randomly a goblin runs across the screen for seemingly no reason, so we added that goblin and tied it to a song.
