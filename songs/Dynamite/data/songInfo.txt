Looks like Dynamite Dan has come across some injustice! Looks like BF is in a bit of a pickle! How will boyfriend make his way out of this one?
This songs premise was created from an one of joke that eventually became a running gag that Tom expected "Dynamite Dan" to be in TBB V2. Obviously there was no such thing, but it was decided that he would be made real in the next update, which is why he's here despite not fitting the "Aver Update" theme.
